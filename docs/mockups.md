# Mockups

Mockups are created in figma, then exported here as images. Actual application may not end up looking exactly like these mockups, but it's nice to have them here in the repo.

- It would be cool if the mindmap is an animation, so you can see it being drawn
- Login is optional, users should be able to start drawing without creating an account

- Login modal. Ideally, this is animated to slide in from the bottom, instead of just immediately appearing.

![Canvas (logged out)](./media/canvas-logged-out.png)
- The canvas page when you're not logged in. So you can't go to my files or save the file

![Canvas (logged in)](./media/canvas-logged-in.png)
- When you're logged in, the load and save buttons work suddenly

![My Files](./media/my-files.png)
- Place to show all your drawings. For now, we don't expect people to have THAT many drawings, so  we need folders or anything.
- In the future, we'll need some better way of organizing the drawings. Folders, tags, searchbar, sort by...
