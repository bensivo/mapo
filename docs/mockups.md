# Mockups

Mockups are created in figma, then exported here as images. Actual application may not end up looking exactly like these mockups, but it's nice to have them here in the repo. 

![Homepage](./media/Homepage.png)
- It would be cool if the mindmap is an animation, so you can see it being drawn
- Login is optional, users should be able to start drawing without creating an account

![Homepage](./media/Homepage%20(login).png)
- Login modal. Ideally, this is animated to slide in from the bottom, instead of just immediately appearing.

![Canvas](./media/Canvas%20page.png)
- We should probably show some text / instructions when the canvas first loads (assuming it's blank)

![Canvas](./media/Canvas%20page%20(login).png)
- Same login modal as on the homepage

![MyFiles](./media/My%20Files%20page.png)
- Place to show all your drawings. For now, we don't expect people to have THAT many drawings, so  we need folders or anything.
- In the future, we'll need some better way of organizing the drawings. Folders, tags, searchbar, sort by...

![MyFiles](./media/My%20files%20page%20(card%20options).png)
- Card options expanded, where you can rename or delete a card
